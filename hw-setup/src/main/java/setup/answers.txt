1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Since 0 is still a non-negative number. As we throw the illegal argument exception, the conditional case should be
n < 0 but not n <= 0 in order to throw the error if we have negative number. Thus, we just need to fix
"if (n <= 0)" to "if (n < 0)".

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The base case should be when do the recursive call as we get the first and second fibonacci number where n = 0
and n = 1. Thus, the base case should be n <= 1. Thus, we need to fix "else if (n <= 2)" to "else if (n <= 1)".

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Since the definition of fibonacci number is that it is the sum of two preceding ones. Thus, when we do the recursive
call, we need to sum the numbers. We need to return "getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2);" rather than
"getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2);".
