# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n2 to n3 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
