## CSE 331 hw-graph Part 1 Questions

## Part 1
###########################################################################

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

I add one Node class to store the data in the node. I also add one Edge class to represent an immutable edge with a child
node and a label for it. We should include addNode and addEdge since they will help us to build the graph. The graph also
contains many nodes and edges if we want to remove one or more, we should include removeNode and removeEdge. We also need
the size method where we can check how many nodes in the graph, and isEmpty method to find whether the graph has zero
number of nodes. In addition, I add getAllEdgesFrom, getAllEdgesTO, and getChild to  find all edges from the given
node, find all edges point to the given edge, and find all children of the given node respectively. Finally, I implement
the checkRep method to check whether invariant holds.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

There are similarities and difference with my script tests and JUnit tests. The similarities are both of tests are try
to check whether I successfully add the edges, nodes, get edges, get the nodes, get the children. If I successfully
to that, whether I get those correct. The difference is that I need to check the duplicates in the graph for my JUnit
tests that I can't do in the script tests. I also check the graph with 1 node, 2 nodes with 2 edges in same direction
or opposite directions. Those specific situation I will implement later in the Graph class will also be checked in my
JUnit tests.
