Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

I change the method getAllEdgeFrom(Node<T> node).
I add a checkRep() method, and change my if statement from
if (node == null) to if (!graph.containsKey(node)).
The reason is that I need to check whether the node is
in the graph otherwise I will get nullPointerException.
I also need to checkRep() since I don't want the parameter
null to be the null.
