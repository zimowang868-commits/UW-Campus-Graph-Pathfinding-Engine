created graph graph1

added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

added edge 16.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 12.000 from n2 to n1 in graph1

graph1 contains: n1 n2

the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(16.000)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(12.000)

path from n1 to n2:
n1 to n2 with weight 16.000
total cost: 16.000
